            I'm a thrift store dwellin', tree huggin', music playin', millenial
            from Hawaii with a passion for self-development and a habit for
            tucking in strangers' shirt tags and complimenting strangers'
            outfits. I graduated from the University of Hawaii at Manoa with a
            BA in Psychology and a minor in music. I've worked in the health and
            wellness field for the past 6 years and am a Board Certified Health
            and Wellness Coach. I fled the islands to pursue the digital
            nomad(ette) life and recently worked for a startup as a remote
            health coach. I'm working towards having the means to bring my furry
            baby up here with me!

            Like many, I developed an interest in coding through Myspace. I saw
            that other people had super cool profiles, so I wanted to have a
            super cool profile! I poured in hours looking at other people's HTML
            layouts and messing with the code not really knowing what I was
            doing, but figuring out ways to make it look the way I wanted it to.
            My hobby became designing pages for friends.<br /><br />
            I love puzzles and losing a sense of time trying to solve them; it
            is rewarding being able to have an idea of what you want to build
            and executing it. I am working to expand my skillset so that I can
            be a well-off travel lady $upporting my$elf while doing work that is
            enjoyable and meaningful to me!

          <h2>About Me~</h2>
          <p>
            I love learning and doing a little bit of a lot of things. I am
            passionate about anything pertaining to self-development and have
            spent most of my 20s shamelessly working on both my physical and
            mental health. I spend a lot of time outdoors and enjoy playing
            tennis, climbing, biking, going on hikes, snorkeling, and running.
            My next goal is to run a marathon in a far-away country!<br /><br />
            When I'm indoors, I love playing League of Legends, Fortnite,
            Tetris, Skyrim, and some other indie games. Music has been a part of
            my life since I was lil kiddo and I love to sing and play the piano.
            Currently learning the guitar! Cooking is also a big hobby of mine
            and I'm always on the lookout for new recipes.
